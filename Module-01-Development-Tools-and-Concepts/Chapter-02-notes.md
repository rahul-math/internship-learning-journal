# Why WSL is Needed

## Purpose of WSL
- Modern Data Science and development workflows rely on Linux tools
- Many CLI tools work best on Linux environments

## Linux Tools
- Tools like Docker, Podman, uv, and other CLI utilities have better support on Linux
- Linux provides better compatibility and performance for these tools

## WSL Benefits
- Allows running Ubuntu inside Windows
- Lightweight and efficient compared to full virtual machines
- Provides near-native Linux performance

## WSL vs VirtualBox
- VirtualBox:
  - GUI-based
  - Slower and resource-heavy
- WSL:
  - Lightweight
  - Faster
  - Better performance

## Recommendation
- WSL is recommended for development and Data Science workflows

# Git & GitHub Basics

## Git
- Distributed version control system
- Tracks code changes over time
- Used to manage project history locally

## GitHub
- Platform to host Git repositories
- Used to store, share, and collaborate on code

## Version Control with Git
- Tracks file changes
- Saves changes as commits

## Connecting to GitHub
- Link local Git repository to a GitHub repository
- Push local code to remote GitHub repo

## Basic Git Workflow
- `git add` → stage changes
- `git commit` → save changes
- `git push` → upload changes to GitHub

# Linux Terminal Basics

## Terminal Usage
- Used to interact with the Linux system using commands
- Helps perform tasks faster than GUI

## Navigation
- `ls` → list files and folders
- `cd` → change directory

## Files and Folders
- `mkdir` → create directories
- `touch` → create files

## Linux File Structure
- Organized in a hierarchical structure starting from `/`
- Common directories: `/home`, `/etc`, `/bin`, `/usr`

## Administrative Access
- `sudo` → run commands with superuser privileges
