## 🚀 Key Learnings So Far
# 🌟 Overall Key Learning – Week 1

Week 1 focused on building a strong foundation for modern software development by combining system-level understanding with practical tooling.

- Gained clarity on why Linux/Unix systems are preferred for development and how WSL enables seamless Linux usage on Windows.
- Understood core operating system concepts including boot processes, virtualization, hypervisors, and cloud infrastructure.
- Developed confidence using the Linux terminal, filesystem navigation, permissions, and system commands.
- Set up a professional development environment using WSL, Visual Studio Code, Python tooling, and package managers.
- Learned Git and GitHub as real-world workflows for version control, collaboration, authentication, and project management.
- Integrated AI tools and APIs directly into the development workflow using terminal-based tooling.
- Adopted a developer mindset focused on reproducibility, efficiency, and scalability.

Overall, Week 1 transformed the system from a regular machine into a production-ready development environment and established the mindset required for advanced software, data science, and AI development.

# 🌟 Overall Key Learning – Week 2

Week 2 focused on moving beyond setup and tooling to **building, deploying, and understanding real-world systems** using modern cloud-native practices.

- Gained a clear understanding of **containerization** and how containers differ from virtual machines, including why containers are lightweight, fast, and ephemeral by default.
- Developed hands-on confidence using **Docker and Podman**, learning about images vs containers, volumes for data persistence, networking, and common WSL-related issues.
- Learned to design and build **production-ready backend services with FastAPI**, including REST APIs, data validation, file uploads, and API testing.
- Understood how **frontend and backend systems are separated** in modern architectures, including static hosting constraints, HTTP communication, and CORS configuration.
- Explored **cloud and serverless platforms** such as Vercel and Hugging Face Spaces, understanding their deployment models, limitations, and Git-based workflows.
- Built and deployed **containerized AI and LLM-backed applications**, gaining insight into architectures used in real production environments.
- Strengthened **DevOps and automation fundamentals** through GitHub Codespaces, Dev Containers, and CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.
- Adopted a **system-building, production-first mindset** focused on scalability, reproducibility, automation, and end-to-end delivery.

Overall, Week 2 marked the transition from *writing code* to *shipping systems*, providing practical experience with containers, cloud deployment, automation, and modern backend architecture
